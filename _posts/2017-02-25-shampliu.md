Hi. I'm Chang and I currently manage [The Stack](http://stack.dailybruin.com), a subsidiary of the Daily Bruin. I'm especially passionate about frontend development - data visualizations, ES6, Javascript libraries, React, etc. - and would be very interested in contributing to those kind of open source projects.
